          This project is a work in progress. We are working on documenting our
          best practices to help sustainable development for the long term with
          Ruby on Rails. The Upgrow gem is not yet available and the contents of
          the guide are still being amended, matured, and reviewed. That being
          said, feel free to follow the GitHub repo and stay tuned for the
          latest updates!

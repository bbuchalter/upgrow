<h1>The Upgrow Website</h1>
<p>This is the source code for the Upgrow website. It contains the Upgrow Guide as
well as the API documentation for the Upgrow Ruby gem.</p>
<p>The website is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">Eleventy</a>, styled with
<a href="https://bulma.io">Bulma</a>, templated with
<a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, and hosted on GitHub pages.</p>
<h2>Local Development</h2>
<p>After cloning Upgrow, change to the <code>docs</code> directory, which holds the source
code for the website as a Node package.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ cd docs
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you have the required dependencies using NPM:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ npm install
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use the <code>serve</code> script to run SASS, ESLint, build the pages as well
as start the local HTTP server, all at once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ npm run serve
</code></pre>
<p>Any changes on the templates will trigger an automatic rebuild if the server is
running. There is no need to restart the server.</p>
<h2>Building the API documentation</h2>
<p>The Upgrow Ruby code is documented using <a href="https://yardoc.org">YARD</a>. Eleventy is
able to serve the HTML contents generated by YARD but you must build those pages
manually first.</p>
<p>After cloning Upgrow, install the required Ruby dependencies from the root of
the Git local repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ bundle install
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can invoke the YARD command to generate the documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ bundle exec yard doc
</code></pre>
<p>YARD is pre-configured to output the documentation pages at <code>docs/api</code>. You can
then <code>cd</code> to <code>docs</code> and start the HTTP server from that location by following
the steps above.</p>
